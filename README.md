Update and Delete

In this assignment, you will be implementing the update and delete methods and test the endpoints with Postman. Continue using the same mvc project that we have been using so far. Here is some controller code to get you started.

Your task is to write the services methods that will correctly update and delete a book. To update a book, you will have to use the setter methods from the domain model and then call the save method. As you can see, save is used for both creating and updating. To delete a book, you will have to use the deleteById method. Below, I have linked to the CrudRepository documentation.

Show
In this assignment, you will continue to build our CRUD web application by implementing the show method. For example, when the user visits '/books/1', you are to respond with a view page that has all the information about a specific book.
